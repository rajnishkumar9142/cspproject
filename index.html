               Raising awareness about these rules

              Remember that railway tracks and crossings
               can be dangerous, and trains can
                approach much faster than they appear.
                 By following these safety awareness rules,
                  you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents 
                  and contribute to a safer environment for everyone.</p>
